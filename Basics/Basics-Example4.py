#Write a function that takes in a number and a percentage and returns the percentage of that number.

def percentage(num, percent):
    return (percent / 100) * num
    #only works with test cases with the percentage 10-99 
    #would have to change the 100 to make it work with everything, but for the problem we're trying to solve it works!
