#Write a function that takes in a number of people and a number of groups. 
#The people will be split up into the groups evenly (there might be left over people). 
#Return the number of people in each group.

def split_groups(num_people, num_groups):
    return num_people // num_groups
    #using two divison symbols gets rid of the decimal number and makes it a whole number 
    #which in this case is what we're looking for!
